# Simple Website Template

This project is a minimal and customizable web template featuring clickable social media icons (Discord and Instagram). It uses an `index.html` file for structure and a `style.css` file for styling. The provided logos (`discord-logo.png`, `instagram-logo.png`) and favicon enhance the visual appeal and functionality.

## Files in the Project

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the webpage.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file for styling the webpage, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- **`discord-logo.png`**: The Discord logo used as an icon on the webpage.
- **`instagram-logo.png`**: The Instagram logo used as an icon on the webpage.
- **`favicon.ico`**: A small icon displayed in the browser tab for branding.

## How to Modify and Use the Website

### 1. Edit the HTML:
- Open `index.html` in any text or HTML editor.
- Modify text, links, or layout as needed. For example, you can update the links to Discord or Instagram by editing the `<a href="...">` tags.
  
### 2. Update the Styles:
- Open `style.css` in a text editor.
- Change colors, fonts, or layout properties to fit your design preferences.

### 3. Replace the Icons:
- Replace `discord-logo.png` and `instagram-logo.png` with your own icons or logos.
- Ensure that the file names match those referenced in `index.html` for the images to display correctly.

### 4. Add or Remove Features:
- To add more social media icons, duplicate an existing HTML block for an icon in `index.html`, then update the image source and link.
- Feel free to add other features like custom sections, contact forms, or portfolio items.

### 5. Test the Website:
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to preview the changes and ensure everything looks good.

### 6. Deploy the Website:
- Host the files on a platform like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or any web server to make the website publicly accessible.
